# Mockingbird-Microbiome-Phylosymbiosis-Project
Tests the contribution of MHC and microsatellite genotype on microbiome composition of Galapagos mockingbirds


This is the data and R code for our manuscript "Mechanisms governing avian phylosymbiosis: genetic dissimilarity 
based on neutral and MHC regions exhibits little relationship with gut microbiome distributions of Gal√°pagos mockingbirds"

The data:

mockingbirds_unrarefied.rds == full microbiome data

mockingbird_island_core_css.rds == island core microbiome data

mhc_phyloseq.rds == MHC data

microsat_individual_alleles.csv == microsatellite data

Geographic_mean_distance == pairwise distances between islands

ComparisonType_matrix.csv == pairwise binary file coding whether comparison is within (1) or between (0) species

analysis_code.R == R code for all analyses and figures presented in the manuscript
